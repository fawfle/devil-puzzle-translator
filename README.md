# Devil Puzzle Translator

A solver for the [Torched Products "Mind Bending Octagonal Fractal Puzzle".](https://torchedproducts.com/products/mind-bending-fractal-puzzle?_pos=1&_sid=a1b3a04fb&_ss=r)

The program translates from an easier to solve solution to a more difficult one. The designers of the puzzle created the larger versions by subdividing pieces in the puzzles with fewer pieces (50 to 100, 100 to 200, 200 to 400) meaning the computation can be changed to the significantly easier task of mapping one set of pieces to another. This solution uses the 100pc solution so generate the 200pc solution.

The solutions generated by the puzzle-translator program are then used by the python program "solution_tool.py". "solution_tool.py" is an interactive program that displays the solution and allows you to draw a piece. If the piece is found, it will highlight it on the board. "r" can be used to reset the canvas.
